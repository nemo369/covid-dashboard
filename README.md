## Home Task:
Create a covid status dashboard:

## Guidelines:

- Use React.js framework
- You can use any plugin
- Style must be elegant and beautiful.
- Frontend only - no backend, no database.

 ## Functionality:
- ● You must implement 3 main data components:
    1. Top 10 countries (highest number cases)
    2. Top 10 countries with highest increase rate.
    3. Top 10 most stable countries (most moderate changes)
- ● For each component you will present an interactive chart (plugin of your
choosing)
- ● For each component you will present a table with the data specified in the graph
- ● You can choose any chart type you think fits (bars, line, pie etc..)
● Each click on one of the tables rows will present a drill down into that specific
country’s data in a designated table.
● All tables will allow sorting, paging (if needed)
